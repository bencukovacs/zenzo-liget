# Success Criteria

## User Success

**Primary User Success (Liza - Daycare Operator):**

**Adoption Metrics:**
- Liza uses Zenzo for billing at least 2 out of 4 weekends per month
- After 3-month trial period, Liza prefers Zenzo over manual Messenger-based billing
- Liza checks Zenzo dashboard for upcoming bookings instead of scrolling Messenger

**Time Savings Realized:**
- Billing time reduced from 1-2 hours to 15-30 minutes (60%+ reduction)
- Liza reports "Zenzo makes billing faster" after 2 months of use

**Critical Success Moment:**
- Liza says: "I can't imagine going back to the old way" - indicates she's crossed the adoption threshold and sees clear value

**Acceptable Partial Success:**
- Even if Liza only uses billing features (not full booking management), the project validates that KATA invoicing automation provides real value and the UX is approachable enough for non-tech-savvy users

**Secondary User Success (Dog Owners - Clients):**

**Self-Service Adoption:**
- 30% of bookings come through client portal (vs. Messenger) within 6 months
- At least 3 clients consistently book online
- Zero complaints about booking difficulty

**Convenience Value:**
- Clients find online booking "easier" or "more convenient" than Messenger
- Critical moment: A client books online at 10pm or on weekend when Liza isn't available

**Payment Behavior:**
- Payment cycle reduces from 7-14 days to 3-7 days (faster invoice payment when clients can see balance in portal)

## Business Success

**Phase 1: MVP Validation (Months 1-6)**

**Primary Objectives:**
- Zenzo MVP live in production and accessible via URL
- Liza completes setup, imports 5-10 client profiles
- Liza uses billing feature 4+ times in first 3 months
- Liza is actively using Zenzo for at least one core workflow (billing OR booking)

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Liza handles 15 dogs/day with same admin time as 10 dogs previously (if she chooses to scale)
- Payment tracking errors eliminated
- Invoice-to-payment time reduced 40%+

**Professional Perception:**
- Liza views her business as "more professional" because of Zenzo
- 3-5 new clients acquired through professional booking experience
- 50%+ of clients describe booking experience as "professional"

**Phase 2: Growth Validation (Months 6-12+) - Aspirational**

**Scaling Indicators:**
- Liza scales from 5-10 dogs/day to 10-15 dogs/day (if desired)
- If Liza hires employee, they successfully use Zenzo for operational tasks
- Multi-user capability validated (if needed)

**Market Validation (Speculative):**
- 1-2 other Hungarian pet care operators express interest in using Zenzo
- Willingness to pay ~5,000-10,000 HUF/month (~$15-30 USD) confirmed
- Evidence that Zenzo concept has legs beyond just Liza's operation
