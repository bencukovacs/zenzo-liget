# Project Classification

**Technical Type:** web_app (PWA with offline capabilities)
**Domain:** general (small business pet care - standard requirements)
**Complexity:** low (no heavy regulatory compliance like healthcare/fintech)
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

**Classification Rationale:**
- Web application with PWA capabilities for mobile-first experience
- Hungarian language/currency/KATA tax compliance are localization concerns, not high-complexity regulatory requirements
- Multi-tenant architecture is a technical implementation detail for future SaaS scaling, not an MVP product complexity driver
- Standard security, user experience, and performance requirements apply
