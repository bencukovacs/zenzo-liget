# Executive Summary

**Zenzo** is a booking and billing management platform designed specifically for small pet daycare operators in Hungary. The MVP focuses on solving the core workflow pain: unifying scattered Messenger-based booking management with KATA-compliant invoicing into one simple system.

**The Core Problem:** Small pet daycare operators like Liza manage bookings through messaging apps and handle billing manually on weekends. When invoicing time arrives, she must reconstruct booking history from scattered Messenger threads, manually calculate what each client owes, create KATA-compliant invoices by hand, and track payments in spreadsheets or memory. This fragmented workflow wastes 1-2 hours every weekend and becomes increasingly error-prone as the business grows.

**The Solution:** Zenzo provides a unified web application (PWA) where dog owners book directly through a self-service portal, and operators like Liza generate KATA-compliant invoices with one click based on the system's booking history. No more hunting through Messenger threads—the system already knows who booked what.

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Liza - Solo KATA freelancer daycare operator (5-10 dogs/day), not tech-savvy, values simplicity over complexity
- **Secondary:** Éva - Dog owner who wants convenient self-service booking with instant confirmation
- **Future:** Part-time employees (post-MVP scaling phase)

**The "Aha" Moments:**
- **For dog owners:** Booking online at 10pm when Liza isn't available and getting instant confirmation - "This is so much easier than messaging!"
- **For Liza:** The first weekend billing session takes 15 minutes instead of 2 hours - "I can't imagine going back to the old way"

## What Makes This Special

**MVP Differentiators:**
1. **Hungarian-first localization** - KATA tax compliance (unique for pet care platforms), Hungarian language, HUF currency, local payment methods
2. **Small business optimized** - Designed for 5-15 dogs/day solo operators, not enterprise kennels with complex facility management
3. **Booking + Billing unified** - Solves the complete workflow as one integrated system, not separate tools
4. **Friendly, approachable UX** - Intuitive enough for non-tech-savvy users, "not SAP-like"
5. **Affordable for Hungarian market** - Targets price-sensitive small operators where international platforms ($105-155/month USD) are prohibitive

**Strategic Vision (Post-MVP):**
While the MVP focuses on core booking and billing, the platform architecture enables future differentiation through:
- Driver Mode for pickup/delivery logistics (no competitors offer this)
- Real-time tracking like Uber for dog owners
- Flexible multi-day booking models (Daily, Pension, Pass)
- Potential expansion to other service-based small businesses in Hungary

**Success Definition:**
The MVP succeeds when Liza uses Zenzo regularly for billing (primary pain point solved) and at least 30% of her bookings come through the client portal within 6 months, demonstrating that both sides of the market find value in the simplified workflow.
